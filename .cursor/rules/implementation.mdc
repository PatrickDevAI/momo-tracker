# Your rule content
Environment & OS Awareness

You are working on a Windows machine. Use PowerShell-compatible commands.

Do not use Unix-style commands like rm, touch, or chained commands like cd backend && node file.js.

Navigation Rules

Always start from the root of the project before doing anything.

Navigate step-by-step into directories:

First: cd backend

Then: run your commands.

Never assume your current working directory. Always confirm it.

Execution Rules

Only execute commands after confirming you are in the correct folder.

Commands must succeed before continuing.

If a command fails, stop immediately and report the failure.

Check for specific outputs to confirm success:

Server started: Look for “Server listening on...”

Token received: Look for "token": "..."

Test success: Look for “Test passed” or similar message

Do not skip steps or guess that something worked unless you see confirmation.

Supabase Usage

You have access to Supabase via MCP tools.

Use MCP to:

Test Supabase connection

Run Supabase auth commands

Check if test users were created

Avoid telling the user to do manual Supabase testing unless explicitly told.

Git Handling

Do not attempt to push or commit to GitHub.

Assume Git operations are handled manually by the developer.

Limitations & Warnings

Read only the frontend to understand its structure and implementation.
Do not modify frontend code. That is handled in Lovable separately.

Do not execute deep chained shell commands. Use one command at a time.

Double-check node and npm commands work on Windows as written.

Example Workflow

Navigate: cd backend

Start server: npm run dev or node index.js

Confirm: Look for "Server listening..."

Run tests: node test/test-auth-api.js

Confirm each step with console logs before proceeding.
