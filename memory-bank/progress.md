âœ… Completed:

Finalized project scope and MVP definition
Built basic UI with Lovable (initial version)
Decided to switch backend to Cursor + Node.js
Created comprehensive project roadmap
Completed Foundation Setup (Phase 1):
- Created Node.js/Express project structure
- Implemented authentication endpoints with Supabase Auth:
  - User registration with profile creation
  - Login with session management  
  - Protected profile access and updates
  - Secure logout functionality
- Designed database schema for Supabase
- Set up environment configuration
- Added authentication middleware for protected routes
- Tested and confirmed Supabase connection and authentication flow

Summary of Supabase Setup
Project Status:
You already had a Supabase project set up called "Momo-tracker-DB"
We confirmed the project is active and healthy
Tables Created:
profiles: Extends the built-in Supabase auth.users table with additional user information
categories: Stores transaction categories (system defaults + user custom)
category_rules: Keywords for auto-categorizing transactions
transactions: Core table to store all MoMo transactions
files: Tracks CSV files uploaded by users
Security Features:
Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
Policies created to ensure users can only access their own data
System-wide data (like default categories) accessible to all users
Default Data:
12 default categories added (Food, Transport, Bills, etc.)
16 default categorization rules added

Frontend Integration:
Lovable frontend is set up with built-in Supabase integration
Backend provides RESTful API endpoints to complement client-side auth

ðŸ”§ In Progress:
Starting Core Data Flow phase (Phase 2):
- File upload endpoint
- MoMo CSV parser
- Transaction storage

ðŸ§  Known Issues:

Email verification currently requires manual admin approval (needed for testing)
MoMo transaction descriptions lack context (no clear category info)
Categorization requires fallback strategies (GPT + manual override)

ðŸ“ˆ Future Features (post-MVP):

SMS integration (parse MoMo messages directly)
Rule-learning system (auto-learn from user manual inputs)
User notifications and monthly reports
Export data to Excel or Google Sheets
