Current Focus:

Implementing Phase 1: Foundation Setup from roadmap.md
Completed the following:
- Set up Node.js/Express backend project structure
- Created base API endpoint structure with Express
- Implemented Supabase Auth integration in backend
- Designed database schema for Supabase 
- Added auth middleware for protected routes
- Created project configuration files
- Implemented and tested authentication endpoints (register, login, profile, logout)
- Integrated user profile management with auth flow
- Verified connection to Supabase from backend

Decisions Made:

Using Supabase for authentication and database
Set up project with a modular directory structure
Using environment variables for configuration
Designed schema with user profiles, transactions, categories, and rules tables
Row Level Security to protect user data
Email verification is enabled in Supabase (requires manual verification for testing)

Next Actions:
Complete Phase 1 by creating README documentation
Begin implementing file upload endpoint for Phase 2
Design and set up CSV parser for MoMo transactions
