Problem:
Most finance tracking apps assume users have access to bank accounts or credit cards. In Rwanda, the majority transact via Mobile Money (MoMo), and existing solutions do not serve them well. Manual tracking is tedious and error-prone.

Solution:
This app fills the gap by enabling users to upload MoMo transaction data and get automated, intelligent insights:

Auto-categorization of expenses

AI chat support for querying spending

Visual dashboards for understanding financial behavior

Target User:
Everyday Rwandans who want to track where their Mobile Money is going without switching to bank-based systems
